# Logger

![](assets/logger.png)

- With our logger, there's no need to modify any code. It's built upon Godot's native file logging system ,which means it automatically monitors Godot's native log functions like `print`, `printt`, `push_warning` and `push_error`.
- To help you easily filter through logs, you can use tags.
- If you need to keep an eye on the logger output in real-time you can overlay it on your screen.
