![](assets/key_binding.png)

By using this feature, you can bind the execution of an expression to a key, for example, to take a quick screenshot, switch to full screen, etc. Key combinations are not supported at the moment.

They are two ways to open key binding window:

1. Click the `Open Expression Key Mapper` button in REPL Console settings window.
2. Execute `console.open_keybindings` in REPL console to open it.

The keybindings information will be saved to the configuration file.
